Proof: a thematic history
===========================
In Spring semester 2024 I was invited to give a series of four mini-lectures on the history of logic in Majid Alizadeh's Introduction to Logic course at the University of Tehran. You can find my slides below.

1. `The Emergence of Proof in Ancient Greece </pdfs/S1.pdf>`_
2. `The Algebra of Logic Tradition </pdfs/S2.pdf>`_
3. `Frege's Logicism </pdfs/S3.pdf>`_
4. `Hilbert's Program </pdfs/S4.pdf>`_
