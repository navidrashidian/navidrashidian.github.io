<h2>Navid Rashidian</h2>

<p>
    I am a Master of Science student of Computer Science at the <a href="http://math.sharif.ir/">Department of Mathematical Sciences</a> at Sharif University of Technology, supervised by <a href="http://math.sharif.ir/faculties/alishahi">Kasra Alishahi</a>. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Philosophy (with a minor in Pure and Applied Mathematics) from the <a href="http://ut.ac.ir/">University of Tehran</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My interests are very broad but I am currently mostly thinking about some problems in probability theory and stochastic processes.
